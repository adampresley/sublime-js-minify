# Sublime JavaScript Minifier

## About
Sublime JavaScript Minifier is a Sublime Text 2 plugin designed to allow
users an easy way to minify a JavaScript file they are working on. It also sports
the ability to try and find an existing minified file and alter it based on a 
configurable list of file name suffixes. For example, when minifying *yourFile.js*
it will look for *youFile.min.js* or *yourFile-min.js*.


## Installation
To install this plugin use the Sublime Text 2 Package Control plugin found at
http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control. Start by pressing *CTRL + SHIFT + P*
and find **Package Control: Install Package** and press *Enter*. You can search for the 
JavaScript Minifier plugin by the name of **JS Minify**.

Once complete you should be able to open a JavaScript file and execute it one of the 
following ways:

* CTRL + ALT + M
* Right-click -> Adam Presley -> Minify JavaScript
* Tools -> Adam Presley -> Minify JavaScript
