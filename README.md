# Sublime JavaScript Minifier

## About
Sublime JavaScript Minifier is a Sublime Text 2 plugin designed to allow
users an easy way to minify a JavaScript file they are working on. It also sports
the ability to try and find an existing minified file and alter it based on a 
configurable list of file name suffixes. For example, when minifying *yourFile.js*
it will look for *youFile.min.js* or *yourFile-min.js*.


## Installation
To "install" this plugin find your User Packages directory for Sublime. In Windows 7
this would be something to the effect of **C:\Users\me\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 2\Packages**.
For most \*nix distributions that would be **/home/me/.conf/sublime-text-2/Packages**.

Download the project and place the *sublime-js-minify* directory into the above packages directory. 
This will load up the plugin. It also will create menus, context menus, and a key binding. 

Once complete you should be able to open a JavaScript file and execute it one of the 
following ways:

* CTRL + ALT + M
* Right-click -> Adam Presley -> Minify JavaScript
* Tools -> Adam Presley -> Minify JavaScript
